# Transformer Text Generation Model from Scratch

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to build a text generation model from scratch using the Transformer architecture. The model consists of several key components, such as a custom tokenizer, embedding layer, positional encoding, attention mechanisms, and more. The goal is to develop a simple yet powerful language model that can generate coherent and diverse text.

## 1. Introduction
This notebook presents a step-by-step approach to building a transformer model for text generation. The implementation focuses on the core components that make up the transformer architecture and how they can be applied to generate meaningful text sequences.

## 2. Tokenizer
A simple tokenizer is used to convert input text into numerical tokens. The tokenizer splits text into subwords or words and converts them to unique integer IDs, which can be fed into the neural network. This is essential for the model to process and generate text.

### Key points:
- Tokenizes input text into words/subwords.
- Converts tokens into integer IDs for model input.

## 3. Embedding Layer
The embedding layer maps the integer IDs of the tokens into dense vectors, representing each word or subword in a continuous vector space. This allows the model to capture semantic information about the words in the text.

### Key points:
- Converts token IDs to embeddings.
- Provides input representations for the transformer model.

## 4. Positional Encoding
Since transformers do not inherently process sequence data in order, positional encodings are added to provide information about the relative positions of tokens in the input sequence. This allows the model to retain the order of words in a sentence.

### Key points:
- Adds position-specific embeddings to token embeddings.
- Ensures the model can differentiate between the order of tokens in a sequence.

## 5. Masking
In the context of self-attention, masking is used to prevent the model from attending to certain positions (e.g., future positions in autoregressive generation tasks). This ensures that the model only attends to the previous tokens in the sequence during training.

### Key points:
- Prevents attending to future tokens during training.
- Enables causal self-attention for autoregressive generation.

## 6. Attention Mechanisms
The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating or processing each token. It computes a set of attention scores, which determine the importance of each token in the sequence relative to others.

### Key points:
- Focuses on important tokens based on learned attention scores.
- Dynamically adjusts the focus during training and generation.

## 7. Multi-head Attention
Multi-head attention expands the idea of self-attention by having multiple attention "heads" running in parallel. Each head learns different patterns of attention, which allows the model to capture diverse perspectives on the input data.

### Key points:
- Computes multiple attention mechanisms in parallel.
- Helps the model capture diverse relationships in the sequence.

## 8. Decoder Layer
The decoder layer in the transformer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward network. This layer processes the input tokens and their dependencies, gradually refining the sequence representation.

### Key points:
- Applies self-attention to the input sequence.
- Uses a feed-forward network for additional refinement.

## 9. Language Model Head
The language model head is a linear layer that takes the output of the decoder and projects it back into the token space. It converts the model's internal representations into probabilities for generating the next token in the sequence.

### Key points:
- Maps decoder outputs to token probabilities.
- Enables text generation by predicting the next token.

## 10. Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on a text corpus using a suitable loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) and optimizer (e.g., Adam). During training, the model learns to predict the next token given the previous tokens. Once trained, the model can be evaluated by generating text sequences and measuring the quality of the output.

### Key points:
- Trains on a text corpus to learn token prediction.
- Generates text sequences based on learned patterns.
- Can be evaluated using various metrics like perplexity.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `torch` (for PyTorch)
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas` (optional, for data handling)
- `tqdm` (for progress bars)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib pandas tqdm
```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, simply run each cell in the notebook sequentially. The model will be built and trained, and you can interact with it to generate text or fine-tune it on your own dataset.
